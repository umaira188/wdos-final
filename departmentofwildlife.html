        <h4>Protected Areas</h4>
        <h2>Sri Lanka is home to a diverse array of ecosystems and wildlife, and its commitment to conservation is evident in the establishment of various protected areas. These areas play a crucial role in safeguarding the country's rich biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance. One notable protected area is Yala National Park, renowned for its vast landscapes and diverse wildlife, including elephants, leopards, and numerous bird species. Wilpattu National Park, the largest national park in Sri Lanka, is another key conservation area, celebrated for its natural lakes and a thriving population of leopards. Sinharaja Forest Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a prime example of a tropical rainforest, harboring an extraordinary variety of flora and fauna. These protected areas not only contribute to the preservation of unique ecosystems but also offer opportunities for sustainable tourism, fostering an appreciation for Sri Lanka's natural heritage.</h2>
